# Pathfinding Ruler

## Description

This module adds a new ruler option in the tokens tab. While it is active, a ruler will be drawn from your selected character to the location under the mouse, automatically routing around walls, to make navigating twisty corridors easier for players.

## libRuler version

This fork of the original module adds [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) and [libRuler](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-lib-ruler) compatibility. If you install both libWrapper and libRuler, Pathfinding Ruler should be compatible with Foundry v9. 

This fork should let Pathfinding Ruler work in coordination with:
- [Elevation Ruler](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-elevation-ruler)
- [Manhattan Ruler](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-manhattan-ruler)
- My fork of [Drag Ruler](https://github.com/caewok/foundryvtt-drag-ruler)

Please direct all issues regarding this fork to [this Github repository](https://github.com/caewok/foundry-vtt-pathfinding-ruler/issues).

## Installation

Add this [Manifest URL](https://github.com/caewok/foundry-vtt-pathfinding-ruler/releases/latest/download/module.json) in Foundry to install.
